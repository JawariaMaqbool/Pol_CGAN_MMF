This Repository contains code and data for the article 'Towards optimal multimode fiber imaging by leveraging input polarization and deep learning' . The uploaded  train and test data is for only one polarization state and fiber position, where we got maximum SSIM on test data. MNIST full data file contains labels.
The jupyter notebook contains the full length code.
