This Repository contains code and data links for the article 'Towards optimal multimode fiber imaging by leveraging input polarization and deep learning'. You can download data from Google Drive links. The train and test data are for only one polarization state and fiber position, where we got maximum SSIM on test data. MNIST's full data file contains labels.
The Jupyter Notebook contains the full-length code.
